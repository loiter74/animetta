"""Contrib TTS implementations — maintained but not in core CI path.

These implementations are maintained but have external dependencies or
are experimental. They are excluded from the mandatory CI test suite
(mark tests with @pytest.mark.contrib).

Quarterly review: implementations unused for 2 consecutive quarters
should be archived.
