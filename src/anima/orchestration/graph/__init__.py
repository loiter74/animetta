LangGraph node module

Implements each processing node, each node is responsible for:
1. Reading specific fields from the state
2. Calling existing services (implementations in services/)
3. Writing results back to the state

Node principles:
- Do not rewrite business logic, reuse all existing services
- Only responsible for state transitions and service calls
- Error handling: set state["error"] on failure
